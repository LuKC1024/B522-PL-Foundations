Naturals
--------

Concepts: datatype definitions, constructors, `Set`.

```
data Nat : Set where
  zero : Nat
  suc : Nat → Nat
```

Here are some natural numbers:

```
one = suc zero
two = suc (suc zero)
```

The main way to eliminate a datatype in Agda is to define a function
on it. Often, the function is recursive.

```
add : Nat → Nat → Nat
add zero n = n
add (suc m) n = suc (add m n)
```

```
three = add two one
```

To talk about equality we import Agda's `≡` operator.

```
open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality using (_≡_; refl)
```

To prove that something is equal to itself, use `refl`.

```
two-plus-one-is-three : add two one ≡ suc (suc (suc zero))
two-plus-one-is-three = refl
```

Proofs about all the naturals numbers
-------------------------------------

To prove something about all the natural numbers,
such as 

    x + y + x ≡ 2 * x + y

for all x and y, your plan A should be to try and prove
it using the laws of algebra, which are provided in the Agda
standard library.

```
open import Data.Nat
open import Data.Nat.Properties
open Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality.≡-Reasoning using (begin_; _≡⟨_⟩_; _∎)
open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality using (sym; cong; cong₂)
```

See the Agda standard library module `Algebra.Definitions` for the
definitions of thinks like `RightIdentity`.

```
xyx : (x : ℕ) → (y : ℕ) → x + y + x ≡ 2 * x + y
xyx x y =
  begin
    (x + y) + x
  ≡⟨ +-assoc x y x ⟩
    x + (y + x)
  ≡⟨ cong₂ _+_ {x = x} refl (+-comm y x) ⟩
    x + (x + y)
  ≡⟨ sym (+-assoc x x y) ⟩
    (x + x) + y
  ≡⟨ cong₂ _+_ {u = y} (cong₂ _+_ refl (sym (+-identityʳ x))) refl ⟩
    (x + (x + zero)) + y
  ≡⟨ refl ⟩
    2 * x + y
  ∎
```


Induction
---------

If you don't see a way to prove something about all the natural
numbers using the laws of algebra, then your plan B should be to use
induction.

Such situations often arise when you need to prove something about a
function that you have defined. For example, consider the following
silly example of a recursive function that doubles its input.

```
dub : ℕ → ℕ
dub 0 = 0
dub (suc n) = suc (suc (dub n))
```

We prove that `dub` is correct by induction. That is, we write a
recursive function that takes an integer and returns a proof that

    dub n ≡ n + n

The easiest part of a proof-by-induction is the base case, that is,
for zero. If you have trouble with the base case, there's a good
chance that what you're trying to prove is actually false.

The high-point of a proof-by-induction is the use of the induction
hypothesis (IH), that is, when we make a recursive call. Sometimes we
need to do some reasoning before using the induction hypothesis and
sometimes we do some reasoning afterwards.

```
dub-correct : (n : ℕ) → dub n ≡ n + n
dub-correct zero = refl
dub-correct (suc n) =
  let IH = dub-correct n in
  begin
    suc (suc (dub n))
  ≡⟨ cong suc (cong suc IH) ⟩
    suc (suc (n + n))
  ≡⟨ cong suc (sym (+-suc n n)) ⟩
    suc (n + suc n)
  ∎
```

Predicates, Inductively Defined
-------------------------------

Recall that a predicate is a statement involving a variable that can
be true or false. In math, a predicate `P` is often represented as a
Boolean-valued function, so `P x ≡ true` if the statement is true of
the object `x` and `P x ≡ false` if it is false.

In Agda, we often uses datatypes to represent predicates.  We define a
datatype named `P` that is parameterized over the appropriate type,
the `ℕ` below. We then say that `P x` is true if we can
construct an object of type `P x`.

```
data Even : ℕ → Set where
  even-0 : Even 0
  even-+2 : (n : ℕ) → Even n → Even (n + 2)
```

The following constructs a value of type `Even 2`, so it's true that
`2` is even.

```
Even-2 : Even 2
Even-2 = even-+2 0 even-0
```

Similarly for the number `4`.

```
Even-4 : Even 4
Even-4 = even-+2 2 Even-2
```

Taking this process to its logical conclusion, we prove that every
number of the form `2 * n`, or equivalently `n + n`, is even.
We'll do this by defining a recursive function `even-dub`
that takes a number `n` and produces an object of type
`Even (n + n)`.

To do this, we'll need a simple equation about addition, which we can
obtain using an automatic solver.

```
open import Data.Nat.Solver using (module +-*-Solver)
open +-*-Solver

snsn≡nn2 : (n : ℕ) → ((1 + n) + (1 + n)) ≡ (n + n) + 2
snsn≡nn2 = solve 1 (λ n → ((con 1 :+ n) :+ (con 1 :+ n)) := (n :+ n) :+ con 2) refl
```

Here's the definition of `even-dub`.

```
even-dub : (n : ℕ) → Even (n + n)
even-dub zero = even-0
even-dub (suc n) rewrite snsn≡nn2 n =
    let IH : Even (n + n)
        IH = even-dub n in
    even-+2 (n + n) IH
```

* For the base case, we construct an object of type `Even (0 + 0)`,
  that is `Even 0`, using `even-0`.

* For the induction step, we need to construct an object of type `Even
  (suc (n + suc n))`. We `rewrite` using the equation `snsn≡nn2` to
  transform this goal to `Even ((n + n) + 2)`. By the induction
  hypothesis (i.e. recursive call to `even-dub`), we have `Even (n +
  n)`, so we conclude by applying the constructor `even-+2`.


If we know a number is `Even`, then it must have been generated by one
of the two rules. We can use the pattern matching associated with
function definitions to reason backwards about the rules.  For
example, if `Even m` and `m` is not zero, then there is a number `n`
two less-than `m` that is also even.

```
open import Relation.Binary.PropositionalEquality using (_≢_)
open import Data.Empty using (⊥-elim)
```

```
inv-Even : (n m : ℕ) → Even m → m ≢ 0 → n + 2 ≡ m → Even n
inv-Even n .0 even-0 m≢0 n+2≡m = ⊥-elim (m≢0 refl)
inv-Even n .(n' + 2) (even-+2 n' even-m) m≢0 n+2≡m
    rewrite +-cancelʳ-≡ n n' n+2≡m = even-m
```

* In the case for `even-0`, we have a contradiction: `m ≡ 0` and `m ≢ 0`.
  We can `⊥-elim` to prove anything from a proof of false, written `⊥`.
  Also, recall that `m ≢ 0` is short for `¬ (m ≡ 0)` and
  negation is shorthand for implication to false, in this case
  `m ≡ 0 → ⊥`. 

* In the case for `even-+2` we know that `m` is `n' + 2`,
  so `n + 2 ≡ n' + 2` and therefore `n = n'` by
  `+-cancelʳ-≡`. We have `even-m : Even n'` and
  the goal is `Even n`, so we conclude by rewriting by 
  `n = n'` and then using `even-m`.
